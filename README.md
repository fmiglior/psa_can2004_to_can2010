# psa_can2004_to_can2010


***be careful this can damage your car, I am not responsible for the use of the codes here***


convert psa can2004 code to can2010, to use a peugeot 3008 I-cockpit display in any psa can2004 car.


This project was possible, because they (AUTOWP and LUDWIGVASSEUR) shared all the codes and instructions:

Autowp have a lot of the psa can bus code, and the instructions to how to read the can confort(2004)/ can info div(2010) codes from the car.

Ludwigvasseur did a great job changing his car radio to the Can2010 RCC, you can find all the instrutions and the code to convert the can2004 signal to the can2010.
